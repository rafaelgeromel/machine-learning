The google colab portion of the lab was very insightful.
It presented me with a new yet very similar environment that I was unaware of it's existance, and that I can use for future projects.
The tutorial also helped me in understading a bit more how to use tensor flow and keras for neural network model creation.
The overfitting tutorial was very nice in presenting graphs that better illustrated some of the concepts previously learnt in class.
